- **e.**

The expected Huffman cost for a document with equal character frequencies is approximately:

Huffman Cost = N - 1

This means that the expected Huffman cost for any document with an alphabet where every character has the same frequency is equal to N - 1, regardless of the specific content of the document. It is a consistent cost value across documents with this property.
